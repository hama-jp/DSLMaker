## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Pipeline

The system follows a sequential 4-stage pipeline where each agent specializes in a specific aspect of workflow generation:

```
User Input ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Quality Assurance ‚Üí Final DSL
```

### Agent Roles & Responsibilities

| Agent | Primary Function | Input | Output | Quality Focus |
|-------|------------------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Requirements Clarification** | Analyzes ambiguous user input and generates clarifying questions | Raw user request | Structured requirements with confidence scoring | Requirement completeness |
| **Workflow Architecture** | Selects optimal patterns and designs node structure | Clarified requirements | Workflow architecture with performance estimates | Pattern selection & scalability |
| **Node Configuration** | Enhances nodes with optimized prompts and parameters | Architecture specification | Fully configured workflow with advanced settings | Prompt engineering & optimization |
| **Quality Assurance** | Validates entire workflow and generates final DSL | Configured workflow | Production-ready Dify YAML with quality report | Production readiness |

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### 1. Requirements Clarification Agent

**File**: `src/agents/requirements-agent.ts`

**Capabilities**:
- Identifies 7 types of ambiguities (vague language, unclear inputs/outputs, missing business logic, etc.)
- Generates contextual clarifying questions in 6 categories: `input_data`, `output_format`, `business_logic`, `integration`, `performance`, `constraints`
- Provides confidence scoring (0-1) based on requirement completeness
- Supports iterative clarification with follow-up questions
- Builds structured final requirements from user answers

**Key Features**:
```typescript
export interface ClarifiedRequirements {
  originalInput: string
  businessIntent: string
  detectedWorkflowType: string
  complexity: string
  clarificationQuestions: ClarificationQuestion[]
  answers: Record<string, string>
  finalRequirements: {
    dataInputs: Array<{name, type, description, required}>
    outputRequirements: string[]
    businessLogic: string[]
    integrationNeeds: string[]
    performanceRequirements: string[]
    securityConstraints: string[]
  }
  confidence: number
  needsMoreClarification: boolean
}
```

### 2. Workflow Architecture Agent

**File**: `src/agents/architecture-agent.ts`

**Capabilities**:
- Selects from 5 proven workflow patterns: Linear, Conditional Routing, Parallel Processing, RAG Pipeline, RAG with Routing
- Designs optimal node sequences with proper dependencies and positioning
- Calculates performance estimates (token usage, response time, costs)
- Applies pattern-specific optimizations
- Designs comprehensive data flow and error handling strategies

**Pattern Selection Logic**:
```typescript
// Intelligent pattern selection based on requirements
if (requiresKnowledgeRetrieval(requirements)) {
  if (requiresConditionalLogic(requirements)) {
    return PATTERNS.RAG_WITH_ROUTING  // Hybrid approach
  }
  return PATTERNS.RAG_PIPELINE        // Knowledge-focused
}
if (requiresParallelProcessing(requirements)) {
  return PATTERNS.PARALLEL_PROCESSING // Multi-faceted analysis
}
if (requiresConditionalLogic(requirements)) {
  return PATTERNS.CONDITIONAL_ROUTING // Decision-based routing
}
return PATTERNS.LINEAR_PROCESSING     // Simple transformation
```

### 3. Node Configuration Agent

**File**: `src/agents/node-configuration-agent.ts`

**Capabilities**:
- Enhances each node type with production-ready configurations
- Performs advanced prompt engineering with system/user prompt optimization
- Applies performance optimizations (model selection, temperature tuning, token limits)
- Implements comprehensive error handling with retry logic and fallbacks
- Generates quality assurance specifications and test cases
- Assesses deployment readiness with integration requirements

**Prompt Engineering Example**:
```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are ${roleDefinition}.

Your primary task: ${taskDescription}

Key Guidelines:
1. Maintain accuracy and factual correctness
2. Provide clear, actionable responses
3. Be concise while being comprehensive

Business Context: ${businessIntent}

Quality Standards:
- Base responses on provided context when available
- Clearly indicate when information is uncertain
- Maintain professional tone throughout`
```

### 4. Quality Assurance Agent

**File**: `src/agents/quality-assurance-agent.ts`

**Capabilities**:
- Performs 6-dimensional validation: Structural, Configuration, Performance, Security, Usability, Best Practices
- Generates quality scores (0-100) and grades (A-F)
- Identifies issues with severity levels: `critical`, `major`, `minor`, `info`
- Provides actionable recommendations with priority levels
- Suggests performance, cost, reliability, and usability optimizations
- Generates final production-ready Dify DSL YAML

**Quality Assessment Structure**:
```typescript
export interface QualityAssessment {
  overallScore: number                    // 0-100 comprehensive score
  grade: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'F'    // Letter grade for quality
  readinessLevel: 'production' | 'staging' | 'development' | 'needs_work'
  detailedIssues: QualityIssue[]         // Categorized issues with solutions
  recommendations: Recommendation[]       // Prioritized improvements
  optimizations: Optimization[]          // Performance enhancements
  finalWorkflow: any                     // Complete Dify DSL YAML
}
```

### 5. Workflow Generation Coordinator

**File**: `src/agents/workflow-generation-coordinator.ts`

**Capabilities**:
- Orchestrates all 4 agents in sequential pipeline
- Manages progress tracking with real-time updates
- Handles error recovery and retry logic
- Supports user preferences (complexity, performance, budget)
- Integrates existing knowledge bases
- Provides comprehensive generation metadata and recommendations

**Usage Example**:
```typescript
import { generateWorkflowFromInput } from './agents/workflow-generation-coordinator'

const result = await generateWorkflowFromInput(
  "Create a customer support chatbot that can answer questions about our products",
  {
    onProgress: (progress) => console.log(`${progress.stage}: ${progress.progress}%`),
    preferences: {
      complexity: 'Moderate',
      performance: 'balanced',
      budget: 'medium'
    }
  }
)

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Quality Score: ${result.qualityScore}/100`)
  console.log(`Readiness: ${result.readinessLevel}`)
  // result.finalWorkflow contains complete Dify DSL
}
```
